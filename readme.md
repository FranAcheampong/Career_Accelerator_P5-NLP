# ðŸš€ Friendly Web Interface for ML Projects with Gradio ðŸš€

There are many ways to make web interfaces to allow interaction with Machine Learning models and we will cover one of them.

# Introduction
The global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has been substantial, leading to repercussions in economies, societies, and the lives of people worldwide. A major endeavor undertaken to address this crisis has been the creation and dissemination of COVID-19 vaccines. These vaccines have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in preventing severe illness and fatalities. However, misinformation and contentious debates have also emerged regarding their safety, efficacy, and equitable distribution.

## Project Description

To execute a sentiment analysis of COVID-19 vaccine tweets, we can leverage pre-trained models from Huggingface. These models have undergone training on vast amounts of text data and can be fine-tuned for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including sentiment analysis. By assembling a dataset of tweets relevant to COVID-19 vaccines, we can utilize these pre-trained models to categorize the tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.
